# Claude Code Practices — Tracked Checklist

> Source-of-truth for which Claude Code best practices we audit our workspace against. Each row has a `last_verified` date. The `practices-audit` skill re-checks all sources and updates dates. Pre-commit and SessionStart hooks warn when `last_full_audit` is stale.
>
> **Cadence:** soft reminder at 30 days · pre-commit warning at 60 days. Manual re-audit via the `practices-audit` skill.

## Schema

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Category | Hooks · Skills · Subagents · Slash commands · Settings · Memory · MCP · Context engineering · Plugin packaging |
| Practice | The specific practice or convention |
| Our state | What we have today (or `not adopted`) |
| Status | `current` (matches docs) · `partial` (some adoption) · `behind` (docs show different) · `deferred` (consciously skipped) · `uncertain` (need verification) |
| Last verified | ISO date when this row was checked against source |
| Source | URL of the authoritative doc |

| Practice | Our state | Status | Last verified | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Custom commands have been merged into skills — `/X` works whether at `.claude/commands/X.md` or `.claude/skills/X/SKILL.md` | partially aligned — we still have ds-check + design-variants as commands | partial | 2026-05-09 | code.claude.com/docs/en/skills (commands→skills migration note) |

| Custom MCP server for rr-insights | not adopted | deferred (Tier 3 of context-architecture roadmap; only worth building when usage shows the gap) | 2026-05-09 | docs/governance/context-architecture.md §6 Tier 3 |

## Context engineering

| Practice | Our state | Status | Last verified | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Just-in-time retrieval (lazy-load reference content) | ✅ DS reference lazy-loaded; cross-corpus subagent for Ring 2 distillation | current | 2026-05-09 | anthropic.com/engineering/effective-context-engineering-for-ai-agents |
| Structured note-taking files (NOTES.md, claude-progress.txt) for long-running work | not adopted | deferred (we use TaskCreate for in-conversation tracking; persistent notes via memory) | 2026-05-09 | anthropic.com/engineering/effective-context-engineering-for-ai-agents |

## Plugin packaging

| Practice | Our state | Status | Last verified | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `marketplace.json` for sharing skills/hooks/subagents | not adopted | deferred (workspace is single-team; revisit if we want to share) | 2026-05-09 | code.claude.com/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces |
| Plugin subagents cannot use `hooks`/`mcpServers`/`permissionMode` (security) | known — not relevant since we don't ship as plugin | n/a | 2026-05-09 | (same) |

## Product design with Claude

| Practice | Our state | Status | Last verified | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Anthropic-Verified `design` plugin** scope (design critique, UX writing, a11y audits, research synthesis) | partial — we have `intake`/`research-intake` covering research synthesis; design-critique mirrored as workspace skill (commit pending) | partial | 2026-05-09 | claude.com/plugins/design |
| **Anthropic-Verified `frontend-design` plugin** (BOLD aesthetic, anti-generic, vary fonts) | ⚠ **anti-adopted** — directly fights our DS discipline. Hostile to enterprise token-locked DS. Documented in `.claude/skills/README.md` to prevent future installation | n/a | 2026-05-09 | claude.com/plugins/frontend-design + github.com/anthropics/skills (frontend-design SKILL.md) |
| **Anthropic-Verified `figma` plugin** (`/implement-design`, `/create-design-system-rules`, `/code-connect-components`) | partial — Figma MCP active via plugin; slash commands available but not formally adopted into workflow | partial | 2026-05-09 | claude.com/plugins/figma |
| `/create-design-system-rules` for DS rule generation | not adopted | deferred (we already have DESIGN.md §4 with 43 rules; revisit only if we want to diff against an auto-generated baseline) | 2026-05-09 | (same) |
| **Claude Design** (Anthropic Labs canvas+chat product, Apr 2026) — DS ingestion, sliders, web-capture, Canva/PDF/PPTX/HTML export | not adopted | deferred (separate Anthropic product, not a Claude Code skill — worth user trial; would complement the workspace, not replace it) | 2026-05-09 | anthropic.com/news/claude-design-anthropic-labs |
| **Claude Artifacts** (canvas in claude.ai for React/HTML/Tailwind generation) | not adopted | deferred (overlaps Claude Code's tsx generation; uses different DS than ours) | 2026-05-09 | claude.com/blog/build-artifacts |
| **Magic Patterns MCP** workflow | adopted — MCP wired via plugin | current | 2026-05-09 | (third-party; no Anthropic-published guidance) |
| **Mobbin MCP** workflow | adopted — MCP wired via plugin | current | 2026-05-09 | (third-party; no Anthropic-published guidance) |
| Stochastic design (parallel agents per variant in worktrees) | ✅ `design-variants` skill — Anthropic publishes the mechanism (multi-Claude parallelism via worktrees) but no design-specific guidance; our skill is a novel application | current (novel application of published primitive) | 2026-05-09 | code.claude.com/docs/en/best-practices (multi-agent + worktrees sections) |
| **Verify-UI-changes-visually pattern** (paste screenshot → Claude screenshot result → list diffs → fix) | not adopted as formal step in `/design-variants` | deferred (would tighten variant convergence; revisit if variants drift visually from intent) | 2026-05-09 | code.claude.com/docs/en/best-practices |
| DS enforcement (token discipline, component-from-DS-only, no-raw-HTML rules) | ✅ workspace-novel — Anthropic doesn't ship a DS-discipline pattern; ours (DESIGN.md §4 + `ds-check` + `ds-component-check` + PreToolUse blocking) fills the gap | current (workspace-original) | 2026-05-09 | (none — workspace authored) |
| Research-to-design intake (transcripts → ADRs → personas → glossary) | ✅ workspace-novel — Anthropic's `design` plugin lists "research synthesis" as a use case but doesn't publish patterns; ours (`intake` + `research-intake` skills) is more thorough | current (workspace-original) | 2026-05-09 | (`design` plugin scope claim only) |

### Visualization anti-patterns (banned by VIZ-011)

Per the May 9 viz audit (Tufte / Few / Knaflic / Schwabish / FT canon). These don't appear in our work — adding here so they DON'T silently re-introduce themselves.

| Anti-pattern | Why banned | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Gauges / dials / speedometers | "Inefficient use of space, mimic dashboards in cars not screens" | Few, *Information Dashboard Design* |
| Donut / pie with >5 slices | Eye can't accurately compare angles beyond a few wedges | Cleveland 1985 perception experiments |
| Exploded pies | Adds chartjunk without information | Tufte, *VDQI* |
| 3D anything (3D bars, 3D pies, isometric charts) | Distorts perceived magnitudes | Tufte, *VDQI* |
| Dual y-axis line charts | Always misleading; readers infer correlation that may not exist | Schwabish, *Better Data Visualizations* |
| Stacked bars with >4 stacks | Becomes unreadable; only the bottom stack has a true zero baseline | Schwabish |
| Bar chart with non-zero baseline | Distorts magnitudes; only line/dot can do this honestly | Tufte, *VDQI* |
| Legend when direct labels fit | Forced eye traversal; direct-label is faster | Knaflic, *Storytelling with Data* |
| Rainbow / jet colormap for ordered data | Hue is categorical, not ordered — use sequential lightness | Borland 2007 |
| Red for "low score" | VIZ-004 — Aarti's directive across all score/rating viz | Workspace memory |
| Toast/Sonner for analytics drill-downs | DS rule — use inline expansion | DESIGN.md DS-008 |
| Animations longer than 300ms on data updates | DS-009 — purposeful motion only | Workspace memory |
| Chart without title + takeaway sentence | VIZ-008 — annotation IS the chart | Knaflic |
| Progress bars for anything that isn't 0→100% in-flight | VIZ-001 | Workspace memory |

### Accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA) — coverage table after 2026-05-09 audit

Anthropic publishes almost nothing prescriptive on a11y; their `design` plugin's a11y scope is a single line citing WCAG 2.1 (one version behind W3C's current 2.2). Authority comes from W3C, WebAIM, Deque, A11Y Project. **Our DESIGN.md is ahead of Anthropic's published baseline.**

| WCAG SC | Title | Level | Our coverage |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1.1.1 | Non-text Content (alt text) | A | ✅ A11Y-010 (added 2026-05-09) |
| 1.3.1 | Info and Relationships | A | ✅ A11Y-004, A11Y-006, A11Y-019 |
| 1.4.1 | Use of Color | A | ✅ A11Y-008 |
| 1.4.3 | Contrast (Minimum) | AA | ✅ A11Y-003 |
| 1.4.11 | Non-text Contrast | AA | ✅ A11Y-017 (added 2026-05-09) |
| 2.1.1 | Keyboard | A | ✅ A11Y-006 + DS substructure |
| 2.1.2 | No Keyboard Trap | A | ✅ A11Y-018 (added 2026-05-09) |
| 2.4.1 | Bypass Blocks | A | ✅ A11Y-012 (added 2026-05-09) |
| 2.4.3 | Focus Order | A | ✅ A11Y-018 |
| 2.4.4 | Link Purpose | A | ✅ A11Y-014 (added 2026-05-09) |
| 2.4.6 | Headings and Labels | AA | ✅ A11Y-019 (added 2026-05-09) |
| 2.4.7 | Focus Visible | AA | ✅ A11Y-002 |
| 2.4.11 | Focus Not Obscured (Min) | AA (**2.2**) | ✅ A11Y-016 (added 2026-05-09) |
| 2.5.5 | Target Size (Enhanced) | AAA | ✅ A11Y-005 |
| 2.5.7 | Dragging Movements | AA (**2.2**) | ✅ A11Y-015 (added 2026-05-09) |
| 2.5.8 | Target Size (Min) | AA (**2.2**) | ✅ subsumed by A11Y-005 |
| 3.3.1 | Error Identification | A | partial via CONTENT-003 + A11Y-013 |
| 3.3.2 | Labels or Instructions | A | ✅ A11Y-011 (added 2026-05-09) |
| 3.3.3 | Error Suggestion | AA | partial via CONTENT-003 |
| 3.3.7 | Redundant Entry | A (**2.2**) | deferred (revisit when wizards land) |
| 3.3.8 | Accessible Auth | AA (**2.2**) | n/a (no auth screens) |
| 4.1.2 | Name, Role, Value | A | ✅ A11Y-001, A11Y-011, A11Y-014 |
| 4.1.3 | Status Messages | AA | ✅ A11Y-013 (added 2026-05-09) |

**Coverage: 21 of 23 admin-relevant WCAG 2.1/2.2 AA SCs explicitly covered** (was 7 of 23 before this audit).

### A11Y tooling roadmap

| Tool | Priority | What it gives | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` (`plugin:jsx-a11y/recommended`) | **P0** | ~35 static-AST rules in editor + CI; catches A11Y-010/011/014 automatically | low — add to existing `next lint` |
| `@axe-core/react` (dev mode) | **P0** | ~90 runtime checks against rendered DOM during `pnpm dev`; catches what AST cannot (computed contrast, ARIA validity) | low — 4-line bootstrap in app dev mode |
| Lighthouse CI a11y category gate ≥90 | **P0** | Build-breaking a11y gate per route; uses axe under the hood | tiny — extend existing Lighthouse CI |
| Token contrast audit script | P1 | Compute oklch contrast per token pair; fail at source | low — single Python script over `theme.css` |
| `cypress-axe` / `axe-playwright` | P2 | Programmatic `cy.checkA11y()` per critical-path E2E | medium — needs E2E suite first |
| Storybook a11y addon | defer | Per-component axe panel | only useful if Storybook adopted |

### Visualization upgrades shipped (2026-05-09 audit)

5 new patterns + 6 new rules adopted from the audit:

| Pattern | Pattern ID | Rule | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Slope graph (paired) | VIZ-PATTERN-004 | VIZ-006 | ✅ shipped |
| Cleveland dot plot | VIZ-PATTERN-005 | (no new rule — replaces sorted-bar default) | ✅ shipped |
| Small multiples panel | VIZ-PATTERN-006 | VIZ-007 | ✅ shipped |
| Calendar heatmap | VIZ-PATTERN-007 | VIZ-008 | ✅ shipped |
| Progression Sankey | VIZ-PATTERN-008 | VIZ-009 | ✅ shipped |
| (no new pattern — rule only) | — | VIZ-010 (single-metric cards include trajectory) | ✅ shipped |
| (banned chart types) | — | VIZ-011 | ✅ shipped |

Component upgrades (key-metrics.tsx, trend-sparkline.tsx, ai-insight-card.tsx) deferred to course-evaluation design pass — patterns get exercised naturally there.

### Superpowers skills (locally installed, opt-in adoption)

These ship with the superpowers plugin (already cached at `~/.claude/plugins/cache/claude-plugins-official/superpowers/`). Adopt opt-in only — don't auto-load.

| Skill | Status | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| `brainstorming` | not adopted (recommended) | Matches Romit's "execute after clear recommendation" discipline; pairs with intake. Adopt when next ambiguous design brief lands. |
| `verification-before-completion` | not adopted (recommended) | Cheap guardrail; complements `ds-check`. Adopt as a wrap around design-output claims. |
| `writing-plans` + `subagent-driven-development` | not adopted (when-relevant) | Useful pair for multi-screen prototypes. Adopt at next 5+ screen build. |
| `frontend-design` | ⚠ **anti-adopted** | Tells Claude to avoid Inter, use Playfair, vary aesthetics, use bold asymmetric layouts. Directly violates our DS rules (R1-R12). Never invoke for Exxat work. |
| `test-driven-development` | skipped | Wrong discipline for design prototyping (TDD is for production code, not stakeholder mockups). |
| `dispatching-parallel-agents`, `using-git-worktrees` | skipped (subsumed) | Specialized in `design-variants` already; generic versions add noise. |
| `requesting-code-review` / `receiving-code-review` | deferred | Could be repurposed as "self-review before sending to Himanshu" pass. Low priority. |
| `systematic-debugging`, `finishing-a-development-branch`, `writing-skills` | deferred | Tuned for engineers; not your primary mode. |

## Why this file exists

Claude practices evolve faster than my training cutoff. Without a tracked checklist with `last_verified` dates per row, the workspace silently falls behind. This file is the source-of-truth for "what does current best practice look like" per category.

The `practices-audit` skill (`.claude/skills/practices-audit/SKILL.md`) refreshes this file by re-fetching the source URLs and cross-checking via `claude-code-guide`. After it runs, the `last_full_audit` date and per-row `last_verified` dates update.

`scripts/practices-audit-staleness.py` flags when the audit is overdue. SessionStart surfaces the warning. Pre-commit warns (does not block) at 60 days.
